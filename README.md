# Pig Dice Game

The Pig Game is a popular dice-based board game that involves rolling two dice and accumulating points. 
Players take turns to roll the dice and can decide to "hold" their current points to add them to their total score or continue rolling to earn more points.   

However, if a player rolls a 1 on any of the dice, they lose their current accumulated points for that turn, 
and it becomes the next player's turn. 
The first player to reach the winning score (commonly set at 100 points) wins the game.
